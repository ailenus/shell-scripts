A repository of shell scripts which I wrote and which are useful for my
workflow. They are mostly specific to the macOS environment. Some may be
directly usable on other \*NIX systems, and others may be used with some
small modifications.

* `eclipse.sh` takes no argument and opens [Eclipse](http://www.eclipse.org)
* `ltx.sh` takes one and an optional second argument, and compiles the file
specified by the first argument with LaTeX; an optional argument of "b" in
addition compiles it with BibTeX
